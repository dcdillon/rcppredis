## RcppRedis [![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/eddelbuettel/rcppredis.png)](https://travis-ci.org/eddelbuettel/rcppredis) [![License](http://img.shields.io/badge/license-GPL%20%28%3E=%202%29-brightgreen.svg?style=flat)](http://www.gnu.org/licenses/gpl-2.0.html)

RcppRedis is a Rcpp and hiredis based Redis client for R 

### Dependencies

- [hiredis](https://github.com/redis/hiredis), the main C library for Redis, eg via [libhiredis-dev](https://packages.debian.org/sid/libhiredis-dev) on Debian or Ubuntu
- [Rcpp](https://github.com/RcppCore/Rcpp) for seamless R and C++ integration
- [RApiSerialize](https://github.com/eddelbuettel/rapiserialize) for C-level serialization from the R API

The package should install from source like any other R package provided the
dependency on the [hiredis](https://github.com/redis/hiredis) library is
met. The `pkg-config` script is used to find the hiredis headers and
library. All of Rcpp, RApiSerialized and RcppRedis can be installed directly
from CRAN (which is the recommended approach) or GitHub.

### Getting Started

Run some of the scripts from the `demo/` directory.

### Status

The package works well and is used in production. It is however only providing
a subset of the Redis API.

### History

This package was derived from an initial fork of an earlier attempt named
'rhiredis' by Wush Wu, and has since been extended in a number of
ways. William Pleasant provided some early patches.

### Author
